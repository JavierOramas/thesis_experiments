1) generate object modules that are compatible with the Smalltalk-80* system, 2) execute these modules interactively on a standard workstation, and 3) automatically optimize them for performance without requiring modification of normal compilers or

This paper describes two hybrid systems closely related to Mahler and Pixie. The system does not require any form of training; all components can be used off-the-shelf. It achieves run-time overheads less

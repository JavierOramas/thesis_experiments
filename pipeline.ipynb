instrumentation on a standard workstation, preferably without requiring us to modify the normal compilers and linker', ' These features of modern programming systems are among the most difficult to implement efficiently, even individually', ' The system was implemented and tested with programs having different behavioral characteristics', ' With better performance yet good interactive behavior, these techniques reconcile exploratory programming, ubiquitous abstraction, and high performance', ' Four new techniques work together to achieve this: - Type feedback achieves high performance by allowing the compiler to inline message sends based on information extracted from the runtime system', ' OM takes a collection of object modules constituting the entire program, and converts the object code into a symbolic Register Transfer Language (RTL) form that can be easily manipulated', ' These issues are: integration into a compiler, program representation, hazard prevention, expansion sequence control, and program modification', ' In this paper we present LuaJava, a scripting tool for Java', 'This paper describes the motivations and strategies behind our group’s efforts to integrate the Tcl and Java programming languages', 'Despite the apparent success of the Java Virtual Machine, its lackluster performance makes it ill-suited for many speed-critical applications', ' Most of these algorithms do very well in statically linked, monolithic software systems, but perform perceptibly worse in extensible systems', ' While previous research has primarily investigated functional aspects of such a system, architectural aspects have so far remained unexplored', ' This paper will appear in the March issue of Journal of Programming Languages', ' The design of a practical system is discussed for the FORTRAN IV language', ' Several years ago we designed the Mahler system, which uses link-time code modification for a variety of tools on our experimental Titan workstations', ' The modular structure of these systems imposes a natural barrier for intermodular compile-time optimizations', 'We present an open architecture for just-in-time code generation and dynamic code optimization that is flexible, customizable, and extensible', ' This is true even if the Java byte-codes are subsequently further translated into native code', 'Scripting languages are becoming more and more important as a tool for software development, as they provide great flexibility for rapid prototyping and for configuring componentware applications', ' Aggressively optimizing compilers can reduce this overhead but conflict with interactive programming environments because they introduce long compilation pauses and often preclude source-level debugging', 'This paper

addressed to develop a fully automatic inliner', ' We evaluate HCO on a collection of large Windows NT applications', ' The key idea is to represent certain runtime state (both code and data) in more than one form, and to convert between forms when needed', 'A dynamic instruction trace often contains many unnecessary instructions that are required only by the unexecuted portion of the program',

collect and manage profile information on an end-user's workstation in an automatic, continuous, and transparent manner\", ' Great emphasis is given to the transparency of the integration between the two languages, so that objects from one language can be used inside the other like native objects', ' The first, built on top of the linker, positions code based on whole procedures', ' Since object modules are more or less independent of the particular source language or compiler, this also gives us the chance to improve the code in ways that some compilers might simply have missed', ' Recent research has demonstrated the value of a complementary approach, in which pointer-based data structures are reorganized to improve cache locality', ' This paper discusses the most significant optimization techniques developed over the course of the project, many of which are applicable to other languages', ' Our code motion technique makes use of an interprocedural liveness analysis to discover dead registers that it can use to hold loop-invariant results', ' More improvement should be possible soon; at present we move only simple load and load-address operations out of loops, and we scavenge registers to hold these values, rather than completely reallocating them', \" Many efforts have been undertaken to find new sophisticated algorithms that fully exploit the computing power of today's advanced microprocessors\", ' After initial investigation in the literature, we decided to implement two prototypes for the Hewlett-Packard Precision Architecture (PA-RISC)', ' Machine designers have tried to mitigate the consequences of the processor and memory technology trends underlying this increasing gap with a variety of techniques to reduce or tolerate memory latency', ' In this paper, we argue that these properties are important to generate optimal code for a variety of hardware architectures and different processor generations within processor families', ' It moves simple loop-invariant code out of loops, even when the loop body extends across many procedures and the loop control is in a different procedure from the invariant code', ' This prototype has the ability to move procedures into an order that is determined by a “closest is best” strategy', ' This paper describes prototypes of two hybrid systems, closely related to Mahler and Pixie', ' Our system does not require any form of training, all components are generic enough to be used off-the-shelf', '0 achieves run-time overheads of less than 0', ' Its key aspects include fixed user locations and the deterministic and homogeneous interference intensity', 'The Morph system provides a framework for automatic collection and management of profile information and application of profile-driven optimizations', ' Hot-cold optimization (HCO) is a technique that realizes this performance opportunity', ' This has a significant impact on performance', ' We demonstrate superior performance to current state-of-the- art techniques', 'Polymorphic inline caches (PICs) provide a new way to reduce the overhead of polymorphic message sends by extending inline caches to include more than one cached lookup result per call site', ' The re-optimization process is guided by up-to-the-minute profiling data, leading to superior runtime performance', ' Reoptimized module versions are

Specifically, for urban and suburban area, conventional SPPP model still can be used', ' In addition to making the resulting dataset available for download, we discuss how our experience can be generalized to other scenarios and case studies, i', ' Our system improved the performance by 5 on average and by more than 14 in one case', ' However, when the actual dynamics of the robots change due to external conditions, on-line adaptation of their models is required to maintain high fidelity performance', ' Two different optimization strategies result: an ideal scheme which is not practical to implement, and a more basic scheme that is', 'A mechanical brake actuator includes a manual lever which is self-locking in the active braking position', ' The fundamental structure of the
